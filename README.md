#  [+2] Include more than eight knots
9th Knot starts on Line 134. 17 total knots. 

 [+1] Allow the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledge if a player does or does not have a certain item
I added an item called lint, which adds onto the flame ending of this story. Can be seen on lines 102 to 105. 

    [+1] Give the player statistics, and allow them to upgrade once or twice. Gate certain options based on statistics (high or low. Maybe a weak person can only do things a strong person can't, and vice versa)
The player has 2 statistics: health and anger. Both are modified on lines 108 to 131. Players can also check their statistics in the “destruction” knot. 

    [+1] Keep track of visited passages and only display the description when visiting for the first time (or requested)
All options have an initial text describing the act your character took. It is no longer displayed after the action is done once. This can be seen from lines 134 to 159.
